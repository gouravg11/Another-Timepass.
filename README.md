<h2> Snake &amp; Ladder Game in C++ </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Welcome to the Snake and Ladder game! This project recreates the classic childhood favorite game, Snake and Ladder, using C++. The game uses simple vectors to store the board and the rand() function to simulate dice rolls. The current implementation supports two players, but it can be easily extended to include more players.

<h3>Features</h3>
<b>Simple Board Representation:</b> The game board is represented using a vector.


<b>Customizable Board:</b> You can use the provided board or customize it as per your preference.<br/>
<b>Dice Rolling:</b> Dice rolls are simulated using the rand() function.<br/>
<b>Two Player Support:</b> Currently supports two players, with the ability to extend to more players.

**<h4>*Just a fun fact:*</h4> Who the winner is doesn't depend on the playersâ€”it's all up to the compiler! XD**
